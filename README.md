# Dataset Release Agreement
## Introduction: 
The goal of the our dataset is to develop bus arrival time. The dataset is meant to aid research efforts in the general area of developing, testing and evaluating algorithms for predict bus arrival time. We have copyright on the data and are the principal distributor of the dataset. 

Release of the dataset: This dataset is made available to researchers willing to develop bus arrival time. All other uses of the dataset will be considered on the case-by-case and agree to observe the restrictions listed below.

## Consent: 
The researcher(s) agrees to the following restrictions on the our dataset:

1. Redistribution: Without prior written approval from the Beijing Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology Laboratory, the dataset, in whole or in part, will not be further distributed, published, copied, or disseminated in any way or form whatsoever, whether for profit or not. This includes further distributing, copying or disseminating to a different facility or organizational unit in the requesting university, organization, or company.

2. Modification and Commercial Use: Without prior approval from the Beijing Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology Laboratory, the dataset, in whole or in part, may not be modified or used for commercial purposes.

3. Requests for our dataset: All requests for the dataset will be forwarded to the Beijing Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology Laboratory Investigator(s).

4. Citation/Reference: All documents and papers that report on research that uses the dataset will acknowledge the use of the dataset by including an appropriate citation to the following:
